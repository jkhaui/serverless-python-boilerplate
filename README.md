# **Python Serverless Boilerplate**
<img src="https://misc-ddocs.s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/py-lambda.png" />

Recently, I've found myself building a backend entirely out of serverless
functions. Having used the Serverless framework to bootstrap my workflow, 
I found this starter kit by Postlight which proved even more helpful for 
a quick and simple scaffolding: https://github.com/postlight/serverless-babel-starter

Now I'm switching over to Python and found it has its own unique challenges, 
such as dealing with large libraries used for data science or machine learning. 
Also, Serverless isn't as well integrated with Pip as it is with NPM; therefore, 
there's more reliance on plugins such as serverless-python-requirements. 
This boilerplate will hopefully make it simpler to deploy your Python code 
to Lambda ðŸš€

**Instructions**
Ensure that you have Node.js, NPM, and the Serverless Framework installed. 
Also ensure that your **AWS credentials are configured**. If in doubt, follow 
these steps: https://serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/quick-start/

> git clone https://github.com/jkhaui/serverless-python-boilerplate

> cd serverless-python-boilerplate

> npm install

Then, to run and test locally at http://localhost:4000
> serverless offline

To deploy the entire function as part of a CloudFormation stack:
> serverless deploy

Enjoy!

**Other Notes**
- To demonstrate how layers can be used to offload large dependencies when deploying, 
this example uses the spaCy library and its en_core_web_sm-2.1.0 model.
- Be aware that layers still count towards the 50mb zipped deployment limit; the size 
of the function including the layers is ~40mb).
- The Lambda function is given access to CloudWatch in its IAM role statements. This 
lets it write to CloudWatch logs for easier debugging. Serverless claims that all 
functions have access to CloudWatch logs by default, but for some reason, I didn't observe 
this.
- It also uses the serverless-plugin-warmup to overcome the cold start problem. After 
deployment, the function is automatically invoked once every 5 minutes to reduce any 
noticable latency for the end-user.
- Be wary using Pip on non-Linux systems for packages that contain compiled binary.
